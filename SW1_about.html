    <h2>About the website</h2>
    <div class="about_text">
        <p> This website was created using the Star Wars API called <a href="https://swapi.co/">'SWAPI'</a>.
        Following the division already made in the API, we provided six categories of different data: characters, planets,
        species, vehicles, starships and movies. For each of these categories, a randomized list of searchable elements will appear.
        It is up to you whether you are searching for a specific person or starship, or whether you would just like to explore the Star Wars Universe.</p>

        <p>The creators of this website are two Advanced Master Digital Humanities students, that made this website for the course of Web Information Systems.</p>
